							<b>What are Sianotes?</b>
							<br>
							Sianotes are a temporary asset that are convertible to Siafunds upon the completion and launch of Sia.
							Sianotes are available on the Nxt Asset Exchange, and must be purchased at the market price using Nxt.
							<br><br>
							Download an Nxt Client: <a href="http://nxtclient.org">nxtclient.org</a>
							<br>
							Purchase Nxt: <a href="http://bter.com">bter.com</a>
							<br>
							Sianote Asset ID: <a href="http://87.230.14.1/nxt/nxt.cgi?action=4000&aea=11593659039925686857">11593659039925686857</a>

							<b>What are Siafunds?</b>
							<br>
							Sia has two different currencies.
							The first is Siacoin, which is what must be used for storage contracts.
							Most transcations will be in Siacoin.
							The second is Siafunding.
							Every time that someone spends coins on a storage contract, everyone holding siafunds will get a small fee.
							Siafunds are therefore a source of income for the owners.
							There are, and always will be, exactly 10,000 siafunds.
							Each siafund gets 0.000039% of all coins spent on storage contracts, which means every storage contract has a 3.9% total fee.
							Simple monetary transactions do not have fees, only storage contracts have fees.
							<br><br>
							<b>I have Sianotes. How can I redeem my Siafunds?</b>
							<br>
							Siafunds will be distributed to their owners in the genesis block.
							If you have Sianotes, you can convert each Sianote into a Siafund.
							To claim your Siafunds, you need a Sia address.
							Download this tool to generate an address:
							<br>
							<ul>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/releases/download/siag-v1.0/Sia_Address_Generator-v1.0-linux_amd64.tar.gz">Linux</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/releases/download/siag-v1.0/Sia_Address_Generator-v1.0-darwin_amd64.zip">OS X</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/releases/download/siag-v1.0/Sia_Address_Generator-v1.0-windows_amd64.zip">Windows</a></li>
							</ul>
							Once you have an address, send your Sianotes on Nxt to our original address <b>NXT-K5ZJ-NNR2-4J4B-D92UF</b>
							Include a message that says 'I am redeeming my Sianotes, my Sia address is: [address].'
							When the Sia network launches, your Siafunds will be at that address and will automatically start collecting fees.
							<br><br>
							<b>Why is there a fee on host income?</b>
							<br>
							Sia is first and foremost a business, and this fee is our source of income.
							Unlike other cryptocurrency businesses, Sia does not get profits through premining the primary currency.
							Instead, we take fees from the network that go directly to the owners of Siafunds.
							This serves multiple purposes.
							The first is that initially, there was no money to fund developers.
							By selling Siafunds, we were able to raise enough money to work on Sia full time.
							The second reason is that it gives us a huge income to have a large development force behind Sia.
							By giving the Sia team a huge development fund, we will be able to stay cutting edge and be aggressive with our development and marketing.
							Sia's goal is to replace all centralized cloud storage, and that's going to take a lot of money.
							By taking a non-crippling fee (3.9%), we can fund dozens or potentially hundreds of full time developers and have a marketing budget.
							We fully intend to use Sia as an enterprise product, the same way that Amazon uses S3 as an enterprise product.
							<br><br>
							<b>Legal Disclaimer:</b>
							<br>
							Sianotes have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash.
							Siafunds have no cash value as are not redeemable for cash.
							Sianotes do not represent corporate equity.
							Siafunds are not corporate equity.
							Sianotes may not be redeemed until the 1.0 launch of Sia.
							Sianotes may not be redeemed on any alpha networks, beta network, or test networks.
							Sia is a product of Nebulous Incorporated.
							The network fee structure is subject to change, however 1 Sianote converts to 0.00039% of host income from renting storage.
